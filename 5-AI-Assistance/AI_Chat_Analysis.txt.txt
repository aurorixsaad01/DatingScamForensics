## **Key Scam Patterns**

### **1. Rapid Emotional Intimacy**

The scammer immediately claims a “deep connection,” despite barely knowing the victim.
This is a classic romance-scam tactic designed to lower defenses and create artificial trust.


### **2. Sudden Financial Crisis**

The scammer introduces an urgent financial problem (“my wallet got frozen by the bank”), which conveniently appears right after establishing emotional rapport.
This is typical of social-engineering fraud: create a crisis that only the target can “solve.”


### **3. Direct Request for Money**

The scammer quickly escalates to asking for 20,000 INR for a flight ticket.
Fast money requests—especially for travel—are a hallmark of romance, investment, and impersonation scams.


### **4. Manufactured Urgency & Pressure**

Phrases like “you are my only hope” are designed to push the victim into acting impulsively instead of thinking critically.
The technique exploits guilt, sympathy, and fear of losing the relationship.

## **Manipulation Techniques Used**

### **1. Emotional Leverage**

The scammer uses affection-coded language (“dear,” “deep connection”) to create a false emotional bond.
This tactic is used to override rational judgment.


### **2. Victim Positioning**

The scammer puts themselves in a helpless, powerless situation (wallet frozen) to make the target feel responsible for rescuing them.
This is a manipulation technique that plays on empathy.


### **3. Dependency Creation**

By saying “Please, you are my only hope,” the scammer tries to trap the victim in a savior role.
This increases psychological pressure and makes refusal feel like abandonment.


### **4. Promise of Future Reward**

The promise of a visit is used as bait.
Scammers often dangle emotional or relational rewards to justify their financial demands.
