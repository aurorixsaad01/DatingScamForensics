VIVA QUESTIONS & SHORT ANSWERS
1. Why did you use FTK Imager?

FTK Imager is used to acquire evidence in a forensically sound way.
It preserves data integrity and generates MD5/SHA1 hashes.

2. Why is hashing important?

Hashing proves the evidence wasn’t changed or tampered with.
If the hash matches, integrity is confirmed.

3. Why did you use Autopsy?

Autopsy is free, beginner-friendly, and used in real investigations.
It extracts browser history, images, downloads, and activity timelines.

4. What is the importance of browser history in a dating scam?

It shows the victim’s interaction flow: dating profile → Instagram → email → money transfer page.

5. Why analyze metadata?

Metadata exposes:

missing GPS

missing timestamps

missing camera model
These often indicate stolen or fake images.

6. Why use OSINT tools like Google Lens and Yandex?

Reverse image search helps detect reused profile photos.
This proves fake identity creation.

7. How does AI help in this investigation?

AI detects:

manipulation patterns in chats

suspicious user behavior

metadata irregularities
It strengthens the final conclusion.

8. What is your conclusion from this investigation?

The dating profile is fake.
All data (browser, chat, metadata, OSINT, AI) indicates identity fraud and deception.

9. Why is this project valuable?

It demonstrates:

digital forensics

OSINT investigation

AI analysis

evidence preservation
Using only free tools, making it practical for real cases.

10. What are the limitations of this demo project?

It uses synthetic evidence.
Real investigations require deeper imaging, memory captures, and legal procedures.
