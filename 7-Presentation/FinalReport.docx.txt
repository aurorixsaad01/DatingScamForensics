1. Introduction

This report demonstrates a complete forensic workflow performed on a simulated online dating scam case. Free and open-source tools were used to acquire, analyze, and interpret digital evidence.

2. Tools Used

FTK Imager 4.7.1 – Evidence acquisition

Autopsy 4.21.0 – Artifact analysis

ExifTool 12.76 – Image metadata analysis

BrowserHistoryView 2.55 – Browser artifact viewer

Google Lens & Yandex – Reverse image search (OSINT)

ChatGPT – AI-based interpretation

3. Evidence Acquisition

A fake victim evidence folder was created, containing browser activity, chats, and images.

Using FTK Imager, this folder was acquired into an E01 forensic image.
The following hashes confirm integrity:

MD5: (Insert from EvidenceHashes.txt)

SHA1: (Insert from EvidenceHashes.txt)

These values ensure the evidence was not modified.

4. Autopsy Analysis Findings

Autopsy processed the E01 image and extracted key artifacts:

4.1 Browser History

Visited dating profile: tinder.com/app/profile/124994

Suspect Instagram profile: instagram.com/lovely_sophia99

Scam email opened: gmail.com/inbox/read/112449

Money transfer attempt: moneytransfer.com/send

4.2 Downloads

The scammer’s profile images were found in downloaded content.

5. Chat Analysis

Sample chat logs show:

Fast emotional connection

Urgency creation

Direct request for money (20,000 INR)

Classic romance scam pattern

This supports the case narrative.

6. Image Metadata Analysis

Metadata from the scammer profile images showed:

No GPS information

No camera model

No timestamp

Inconsistent resolution

These patterns indicate that the images were likely:

Downloaded

Reused

Part of a fake identity

7. OSINT Verification

Reverse image searches using Google Lens and Yandex revealed:

The same images appearing on unrelated websites

Multiple profiles using identical pictures

Clear signs of identity fraud

Screenshots of results are attached in the OSINT folder.

8. AI-Assisted Interpretation

ChatGPT analyzed:

Chat logs

Browser history

Metadata

The AI identified:

Manipulation techniques

Emotional pressure

Fraud patterns

Inconsistencies in identity data

This confirms the forensic findings.

9. Conclusion

All evidence—including browser activity, chat logs, metadata, OSINT, and AI analysis—indicates that the profile involved is fraudulent and part of a typical online dating scam.

This demo project successfully demonstrates a complete, professional forensic workflow suitable for academic evaluation.
