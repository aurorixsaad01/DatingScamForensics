DEMO SCRIPT – ONLINE DATING SCAM FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

Good morning sir/ma’am.

Today I will demonstrate a short forensic investigation on an online dating scam.
This is a demo project using free and open-source tools.

Step 1 – Evidence Acquisition:
I created a fake victim evidence folder containing browser history, chat logs, and images.
Using FTK Imager, I acquired it into an E01 forensic image and generated MD5 and SHA1 hashes.
This ensures evidence integrity.

Step 2 – Autopsy Analysis:
Next, I loaded the E01 image into Autopsy.
Autopsy extracted browser history which shows visits to a dating profile, Instagram page,
a Gmail message, and a money transfer website. This helps reconstruct the victim’s actions.

Step 3 – Metadata Analysis:
I analyzed the scammer’s profile images using ExifTool.
The images had no camera model, no GPS data, and no timestamps.
These missing EXIF fields indicate that the photos were downloaded from the internet.

Step 4 – OSINT Verification:
Using Google Lens and Yandex reverse image search, I found the same profile photos
appearing on multiple unrelated websites. This confirms the identity is fake.

Step 5 – AI-Assisted Interpretation:
I provided the chat logs, browser history, and metadata findings to an AI tool.
It identified emotional manipulation, urgency creation, and fraudulent behavioural patterns.

Conclusion:
All evidence—browser activity, image metadata, OSINT, and AI interpretation—
shows that the profile is fraudulent and matches a typical online dating scam.
This completes my forensic demo investigation.

Thank you.
