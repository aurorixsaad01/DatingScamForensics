CASE SUMMARY – ONLINE DATING SCAM INVESTIGATION (DEMO PROJECT)

1. Evidence Acquisition:
Using FTK Imager, the demo evidence folder was acquired as a forensic E01 image.
MD5 and SHA1 hashes were generated, confirming evidence integrity.

2. Browser Activity Findings:
Autopsy revealed visits to a dating profile, Instagram page, and a money-transfer
website. The sequence of URLs suggests the victim interacted with a suspicious
profile and was guided towards sending money.

3. Chat Analysis:
Fake chat logs show clear manipulation: emotional pressure, urgency, and a direct
money request. These are typical patterns of romance scams.

4. Image Metadata Findings:
Metadata analysis using ExifTool showed missing GPS, missing camera model,
missing timestamp, and inconsistent image properties. This strongly indicates the
profile images were downloaded from the internet.

5. OSINT Findings:
Google Lens and Yandex reverse image searches showed the scammer’s images
appearing on multiple unrelated sites, confirming identity fraud.

6. AI-Assisted Interpretation:
AI highlighted manipulation techniques in chats, suspicious behavioural signs in
browser history, and metadata irregularities indicating a fake identity.

CONCLUSION:
All evidence—browser activity, chats, metadata, OSINT, and AI analysis—supports
the conclusion that the profile involved in the interaction was fraudulent and part
of a typical online dating scam model. This demonstrates a complete forensic
workflow for academic purposes.
